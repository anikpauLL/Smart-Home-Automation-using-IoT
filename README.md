# Smart-Home-Automation-using-IoT


An **IoT-based Smart Home Automation system** developed as part of **ETE 416** at **Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET)**. This project demonstrates how household appliances can be controlled wirelessly using an **Arduino UNO**, **Bluetooth communication**, and simple mobile commands.

The system focuses on **cost-effectiveness**, **ease of use**, and **practical applicability**, making it suitable for developing countries and educational purposes.


## Project Overview

Smart Home Automation integrates electronics, communication, and embedded systems to improve convenience, security, and energy efficiency in residential environments. In this project:

* Home appliances are controlled wirelessly via **Bluetooth**
* An **Arduino UNO** acts as the central controller
* A **relay module** safely switches electrical devices
* An **IR sensor** enables basic automation
* A **servo motor** simulates a smart door lock

The system can switch appliances ON/OFF using a mobile phone without complex wiring or internet connectivity.
